Completed: 2026-01-16
Notes:
- Next.js 14+ with App Router configured
- Trigger.dev SDK 4.3.2 installed
- shadcn/ui initialized with button, card, tabs components
- SplitViewer component renders 50/50 layout with context for highlight state
- Homepage lists 3 example cards (progress-tracking active, others coming soon)
- CodePanel component with file tabs and line numbers

## Code panel renders Shiki-highlighted code with line numbers
Completed: 2026-01-16
Notes:
- Shiki highlights TypeScript code server-side in page.tsx (async server component)
- Using tokyo-night theme (Trigger.dark theme not found in npm or Trigger.dev repos)
- Each line shows line number on left with zinc-600 color
- File tabs switch between task.ts, streams.ts, actions.ts
- ShikiLine component extracts individual lines from Shiki HTML output

## Click UI element highlights corresponding code lines
Completed: 2026-01-16
Notes:
- Created code-mappings.ts with progressMappings for UI element to code line mapping
- CodeLink component wraps elements and handles click to setHighlight
- data-code-id attributes on Button, "View stream definition", "View stream.append()" links
- Yellow background highlight via bg-yellow-500/20 class
- scrollIntoView with smooth behavior already implemented in CodePanel

## Progress tracking Trigger.dev task streams updates
Completed: 2026-01-16
Notes:
- Created src/trigger/streams.ts with progressStream defined via streams.define<ProgressUpdate>()
- Created src/trigger/tasks.ts with processDataTask that loops and appends progress updates
- Task accepts { items: number } payload
- Each update includes current, total, message via progressStream.append()
- Uses await with 500ms delay to simulate work
